# Blockchain-Based Healthcare System  

## Overview  
This project is a decentralized healthcare system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity and Hardhat. It allows secure and transparent doctor-patient interactions, including doctor registration, patient data retrieval, and electronic health record (EHR) management.  

---

## Features  
- **Doctor Registration** – Doctors can register using their Ethereum address.  
- **Patient Records** – Patients' health data is securely stored and retrieved.  
- **Role-Based Access Control** – Only registered doctors can access patient records.  
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts** – Data is stored in an immutable and decentralized manner.  
- **Security & Transparency** – Utilizes Solidity smart contracts with access control.

## Tech Stack  
- **Solidity** – Smart contract development  
- **Hardhat** – Ethereum development and testing framework  
- **Ethers.js** – Interacting with the blockchain  
- **Node.js** – Backend integration  
- **React.js (Optional)** – Frontend for UI  
- **IPFS (Optional)** – Decentralized file storage

### Future Improvements  
- **Frontend UI** for easy interaction  
- **Multi-signature authentication** for data access  
- **Integration with IPFS** for decentralized storage  
- **Cross-hospital interoperability**
